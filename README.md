for my art.

## build

-> requires [node](https://nodejs.org/).

after [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository):

-   `npm i` install dependencies

-   `npm run serve` serve localhost

once I write some tests, you will be able to run them via `npm run test` :P
