I think we are all in agreement that 2020 was _horrible_. I would like to make a habit of doing a small review of the year, I've also decided to try and keep this brief because this has been a particularly awful year.

## Before COVID-19
Before the global pandemic of [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/need-to-know.html) had hit the world and we all had to go into lockdown, I took an international trip. I was really excited about traveling during 2020 and wanted to plan many other trips. I am grateful for the opportunities to travel that I had in the beginning of the year.

### Paris

I organized a small week-long vacation in Paris to unwind and combat jet-lag before a week of work in Berlin. I invited my sister and my friend, who both speak a bit of French (lucky for me, as I speak 0%).

We had a wonderful time:

- Visited the [Louvre](https://www.louvre.fr/en) and saw some breathtaking artwork.

- Went to a [mysterious laundry themed bar](https://www.lavomatic.paris/) that had a secret entrance behind washing machines. The drinks were okay and we had to sit on uncomfortable soap boxes (typical city stuff, lol). Overall a fun little experience.

- We walked so much that I wore out my shoes and had to buy new boots! Treated myself to some Doc Martens. ðŸ˜Ž

- Drank amazing wine, ate delicious food â€”including [escargots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escargot)!

- Visited the [Catacombs of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombs_of_Paris) which was an eerie experience. I have never been that close to human bones before, and the history is fascinating.

### Berlin

Berlin is a beautiful city. Extremely cold during January. I went to Berlin directly from Paris for Mozilla's (usually bi-annual) All-Hands.

2020 has been a difficult year for companies and Mozilla was no exception. [There was an unexpected round of layoffs](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/01/15/readying-for-the-future-at-mozilla/) that affected many of my colleagues, I feel fortunate to still be in work.
