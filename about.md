hello & welcome to my about me page! My name is Amy & you've stumbled across my small corner of the World Wide Web. I created this website as a way to share my own thoughts, ideas, tips 'n tricks, and anything else I may want to shout into the void ;)

While a lot of the content on this site will probably be about web development or software engineering, it is very much my personal website and is not intended to act as my resume.
