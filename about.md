Hello! My name is Amy Churchwell. My pronouns are [she/her](https://pronoun.is/she).

I am a front-end developer at [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org) --we are on a mission to ensure the web is open and accessible to all.

When I am not writing code I like to hike trails, practice yoga, study Japanese, and watch Star Trek.
